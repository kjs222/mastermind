Instructions for Mastermind

The goal of Mastermind is to crack a code through
a series of guesses.  The code consists of a set of
colors arranged in a particular sequence.

Depending on the whether you choose the beginner,
intermediate, or advanced game types, the game will
generate a secret code of a set length, from a list
of available colors.  You will be told the length and
available colors.

The secret code may not include all available colors,
and,likewise, the code may have duplicate colors.

After each guess, you will receive feedback on your guess.
You will learn how many colors were correct, and how many
were in the correct placement.  This information will help
you figure out the correct code.

The game also allows you to see your guess history.  The
history can help you crack the code.

The goal is to crack the code in the fewest number of
guesses.
